# untitled-bot-images
images for the untitled-bot stuff i guess idk man why are you even here?

anyways for anyone wondering the images were used in the server top.gg (dsicord.gg/dbl) so it isn't a violation of privacy since it's a public server anyways.

this was used to show some stuff for verification because i didn't want to put the images on imgur but i'm probably going to delete it later anyways.
